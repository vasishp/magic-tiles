# Magic Tiles - Phase 1 Implementation

## üéÆ Overview
A rhythm-based tile tapping game built with Expo (React Native) where players must tap falling tiles before they reach the bottom of the screen.

## ‚úÖ Phase 1 Features Implemented

### Core Gameplay
- **4 Vertical Lanes**: Full-screen layout with equal-width lanes
- **Falling Tiles**: Tiles spawn from the top and fall at a configurable speed (160px tall for improved tap comfort)
- **Progressive Difficulty**: 
  - Tile speed gradually increases from 5 to 12 pixels/frame over 60 seconds (ease-in curve)
  - Spawn rate increases from 1.25 to 3.33 tiles/second (800ms ‚Üí 300ms interval)
  - Both speed and spawn rate ramp simultaneously for balanced difficulty scaling
- **Collision Prevention**: Tiles maintain minimum safe distance in same lane to avoid overlap
- **Tap Detection**: Players tap tiles within a hit zone near the bottom (80px tall zone, 160px from bottom)
- **Score System**: +10 points for each successfully tapped tile
- **Game Over Condition**: Game ends when a tile reaches the bottom untapped
- **Hit Zone Indicator**: White line marking the valid tap zone
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: 8 vibrant gradient themes that cycle every 7 seconds with smooth crossfade transitions and dynamic vibrance modulation

### Game Screens
1. **Start Screen**: Welcome screen with "Start Game" button
2. **Game Screen**: Main gameplay with 4 lanes, falling tiles, and score display
3. **Game Over Screen**: Shows final score, ad placeholder, and replay options

```

## üéØ How to Play

1. **Start**: Tap "Start Game" on the welcome screen
2. **Play**: Tap tiles as they fall through the white hit line
3. **Score**: Each successful tap awards 10 points
4. **Game Over**: Miss a tile and the game ends
5. **Replay**: Choose "Play Again" or return to dashboard

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All game parameters are adjustable in `/constants/gameConfig.ts`:

```typescript
export const GAME_CONFIG = {
  numberOfLanes: 4,        // Number of vertical lanes
  tileSpeed: 5,            // Pixels per frame (legacy - overridden by speed ramp)
  spawnInterval: 800,      // Milliseconds between spawns
  hitZoneY: 160,           // Distance from bottom
  hitZoneHeight: 80,       // Height of hit zone
};

export const TILE_HEIGHT = 160;  // Height of each tile (increased for better tap comfort)

// Background gradients
export const BACKGROUND_CYCLE_INTERVAL = 7000;  // Gradient cycle interval (7 seconds)
export const ENABLE_SMOOTH_GRADIENTS = true;    // Enable smooth gradient transitions

// Speed ramping (progressive difficulty)
export const TILE_INITIAL_SPEED = 5;              // Starting speed (pixels/frame)
export const TILE_MAX_SPEED = 12;                 // Maximum speed (pixels/frame)
export const TILE_INITIAL_SPAWN_INTERVAL = 800;   // Starting spawn rate (ms)
export const TILE_MIN_SPAWN_INTERVAL = 300;       // Maximum spawn rate (ms)
export const SPEED_RAMP_DURATION = 60;            // Ramp duration (seconds)
export const ENABLE_SPEED_RAMP = true;            // Enable speed & spawn ramping
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Game Loop
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animation
- Frame-independent movement
- Automatic cleanup on unmount

### State Management
- React hooks for game state
- Functional components throughout
- Proper separation of concerns

### Collision Detection
- Precise hit zone detection
- Lane-based tap recognition
- Miss detection for game over

### Speed & Spawn Rate Ramping (Progressive Difficulty)
- **Time-based ramping** (not score-based) for predictable difficulty scaling
- **Dual ramping system**:
  - Tile speed: 5 ‚Üí 12 pixels/frame (140% increase)
  - Spawn rate: 800ms ‚Üí 300ms interval (167% faster spawning)
- **Ease-in quadratic interpolation** for smooth, natural acceleration
- **Collision prevention**: Tiles maintain minimum safe distance (1.5√ó tile height) in same lane
- **Performance optimized**:
  - Speed calculated once per frame (not per tile)
  - Spawn interval calculated once per spawn check
  - Uses `useRef` to avoid re-renders
  - Tiles remain isolated from ramping logic
- **Feature flag** allows instant toggle for testing/performance tuning (`ENABLE_SPEED_RAMP`)

## üöÄ Running the Game

```bash
# Start the development server
npm start

# Run on iOS
npm run ios

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run on Web
npm run web
```

  - Themes include: Lavender Periwinkle, Sunset Glow, Teal Dream, Purple Pulse, Sky Blue Aqua, Fiery Coral, Aurora Mint, Neon Sky
  - Smooth crossfade transitions with dynamic vibrance modulation (when enabled)
- Tiles: `#000` (Black)
- Hit Zone: `#fff` (White, 80% opacity)
- Score: `#fff` (White)

## üìã Next Phases

- [x] Gradually increase spawn rate (‚úÖ Implemented with collision prevention)
- [ ] Smooth tile animations with react-native-reanimated
- [ ] Tile bounce/fade effects on miss

### Phase 3: Tile Types
- [ ] Hold tiles (long press)
- [ ] Drag tiles (swipe along lane)
- [ ] Visual indicators for tile types
- [ ] Color coding for different types

### Phase 4: Polish
